1. Mesh => oversegmented patches => segmentation
   1) supervertex/test_compute_supervertex_ncut.m : segment mesh into patches
   2) demo_smo_segmentation.m : patches to segmentation via smo

3.demo_ncut_segmentation.m : patches to segmentation via ncut


2. Mesh => segmentation
   use demo_smo_segmentation_faces.m, but it is too slow for large mesh
